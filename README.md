# MINDCARE-AI
The solution is aimed to creating an application using generative  AI. The application if installed must be allowed to access user social media and casual communication platforms. This will have an end-to-end encryption hence not allowing any third-party access to invade user privacy. The application detects any early signals of stress or mental health conditions judging the user on the way they communicate, the content they react to using social media , the gerne of music they listen to and the frequency of calls they make  and  using IBM Granite. The app will consist of a chatbot enabled through agentic AI. The app will send a notice or  chat request to the user once it detects any signs of stress. when the user communicates the Bot tries to give solutions that it finds using RAG for a vaster solution base. If the user isn't satisfied with the chatbot's suggestions then it will ask the user if they would like to talk to one of their associated therapists, and if the user wishes then they will be contacted to one of the professionals that would specifically give solutions to them more personally <img width="16635" height="81" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/72cf342d-2162-4383-8dcd-3585e2fb88fa" />
